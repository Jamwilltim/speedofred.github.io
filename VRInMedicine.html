    <h1>The impact of virtual and augmented reality in medicine.</h1>

    <p>Medicine is a vast field, with a new innovations being made every day. 
        One of the more promising features includes the use of virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR). There are many applications for these technologies including</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Improving the understanding of patients</li>
        <li>Training</li>
        <li>Theraputic techniques</li>
        <li>Physical therapy</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Improving the understandings of patients @TheGeorgeWashingtonUniversityHospital</h3>

        In summary the hospital now uses VR to aid with "neurosurgery" and "thoracic surgery". 
        The technology enables the visualisation of the patient's body without making an incision.
        The idea originates from "flight simulators designed to train fighter pilots" which was then adapted to allow
        for the mapping of the human body. After planning, the surgeon can easiy demonstrate to their patient
        how they plan to remove their tumor by handing over the headset and explaining their plan in a 3D
        environment.

        AR allows for the simulation of the body in a way which wasn't possible before. Whereas real, 
        physical models used to be the best way to simulate this; VR enables exploration and teaching like
        never before. VR technologies allow for "bespoke surgical procedures" to be simulated
